# Coin-Counter
A C++ coin counter


Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a short program that asks a user to enter an amount of pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half dollars, and dollars. It checks to see whether the amount entered is valid. If not, it will ask the user to re-enter the amount and keep prompting them until a valid amount is entered. Once all amounts have been verified, it will print the amount of coins entered and then print the total amount of money entered in dollars and cents. 


Running the Program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to run the program, you must have a C++ compiler installed. You will then need to download the program, compile, and run. 


Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a very simple program consisting of do while commands to get user input on numbers of coins. It uses if comparison statements to check whether the number entered by the user is valid. Simple arithemetic is used to get the final amount of money and the set precision and fixed command to format the amount correctly.
